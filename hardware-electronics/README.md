## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Safety warnings should be added for electrical safety
- Voltage ratings and current limits should be specified
- ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection should be reminded

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new content:
1. Specify hardware specifications in detail
2. Add images for circuit diagrams (SVG preferred)
3. Use real part numbers
4. Add safety warnings (especially for high voltage)
